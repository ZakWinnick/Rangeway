                    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                    <p>We're building America's premier scenic-corridor EV charging network‚Äîone that transforms charging from an inconvenience into a welcome part of the journey.</p>
                    <p>While others race to cover urban areas, we're focused on the places where EV charging matters most: the beautiful highways that connect us to national parks, coastal drives, and mountain retreats.</p>

                <div class="content-text">
                    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                    <p>We guarantee climate-controlled indoor comfort at every location. No more waiting in parking lots exposed to the elements‚Äîour lounges offer genuine hospitality.</p>
                    <p>Our regional cluster model combines full-service Basecamps with automated Waystations, delivering 99% uptime through shared infrastructure and rapid response teams.</p>

                <h2>Why Scenic Corridors Matter</h2>
                <p>The future of EV travel depends on reliable charging where it's needed most</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-text" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Today, 55% of EV drivers avoid scenic routes due to charging anxiety. That's 1.9 million California EV owners who can't confidently explore Death Valley, the Pacific Coast Highway, or the Sierra Nevada.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">We're changing that. By strategically placing reliable, hospitality-focused charging stations along America's most beautiful drives, we're making electric road trips not just possible, but preferable.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; text-align: center;">The scenic corridor charging market is worth $780M-$2.4B today and growing to $3-9B by 2030. We're capturing it with a proven operational model and hospitality DNA.</p>
