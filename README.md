## Overview

Rangeway builds premium EV charging destinationsâ€”Basecamps and Waystationsâ€”designed for road-trippers on iconic routes. Unlike parking-lot chargers, every site guarantees climate-controlled indoor comfort, reliable ultra-fast charging, and hospitality-grade amenities.

This website introduces the brand, experience, team, and ways to connect.

## Tech Stack

- **PHP + HTML/CSS** (no framework)
- Static assets in `/images`
- Simple includes for layout (`header.php`, `footer.php`)

```bash
# Run a local dev server
php -S localhost:3000
```

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.x or newer

### Local Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `php -S localhost:3000` from the repo root
3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

### Recommendations

## Deploying

Any PHP-capable host works:

- **Shared host / VPS:** Apache or Nginx with PHP-FPM
- **Docker** (optional):

```dockerfile
FROM php:8.3-apache
COPY . /var/www/html
```

- **Environment variables:** Reference them in `contact-handler.php` if using SMTP/API-based email

> **Note:** GitHub Pages and Netlify do not run PHP server-side. Use them only if you pre-render pages.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Convert static content to lightweight CMS (Statamic, Kirby) or headless CMS
- [ ] Add analytics (server-friendly) + cookie banner if required
- [ ] Map & live charger status (OCPI/CPMS when available)
- [ ] Structured data (SEO): Organization, LocalBusiness for each site
- [ ] CI link checker + HTML validation

---

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Keep pages modular (reuse `header.php` / `footer.php`)
3. Run `php -S` locally to verify routing and forms
4. Open a PR with a short demo GIF/screenshot

**External contributors:** Please open an issue first to confirm scope.
